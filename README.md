# Word-Guess-Game
Hangman with JavaScript
This project is utilizing rudimentary Javascript to create a Hangman game that a user can interact with.
The theme I chose for the project was Halloween. In all there are about 29 words to guess from.

Upfront: While most of the project is functioning, I do want to be forthcoming about two glitches. The site does say "Press any key to begin"; however, I was only able to figure out how to get the function to fire with the "A-Z" keys. So if a user tried to press the "5" key the function would not fire. Furthermore, two functions in my code cause the user to have to hit a button twice to successfully reset the game to start at the beginning only when first loading the webpage. Afterwards, everything functions smoothly that I can see. At some point in time I will come back to edit the bugs.

I used Bootstrap primarily to get the main layout of the page designed. Afterward I applied my own CSS to the page in order to fit the theme with multiple IDs. There are a lot of IDs in this code. Seeing that I knew I was going to overwrite some Bootstrap and I was quite reliant on .getElementById function for my Javascript, there are many IDs. I am open to learning more efficient ways to write the code.

I did use Google Fonts ("Creepster", "Bangers") to fit my theme. If there are any compatability issues, please inform me. I wanted to add a more specific font that I found off of the internet, but in my research it seemed more complicated than using Google Fonts for the same effect.

Lastly, please inform me on any copyright issues that might occur. Being that it was Halloween themed, I utilized John Carpenter's infamous score for the film 'Halloween' and the classic 'Monster Mash'. As I am still new to coding I am not fully aware to citing resources, but will gladly like to learn how, and will adapt in the near future.
